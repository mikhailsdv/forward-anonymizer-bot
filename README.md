# forward-anonymizer-bot
Telegram-bot that anonymizes your channel forwards.

> The project is no longer supported since Telegram [added](https://telegram.org/blog/live-streams-forwarding-next-channel#flexible-forwarding) similar functionality to official clients.

Add it to your channel as an administrator and give it permission to delete and publish posts. Then you can simply forward posts from other channels to your channel.

The bot does not save the text of the original post, but only extracts a photo, video, gif, audio or document and publishes on behalf of the channel.
